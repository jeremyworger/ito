# About **ito**

**ito** is a JavaScript library for browser-to-browser communication,
which is intended to work on devices without an input human interface
like keyboard or mouse, of course as well as PCs, smartphones and tablets.

This library is composed of two parts; application and backend interfaces.
While the backend interface can be implemented for various kinds of backend
services, only Firebase is currently supported.

"ito" is a Japanese word "ç³¸" which means "*string*", "*thread*" or "*yarn*",
and is also an anagram of "*IoT*".
